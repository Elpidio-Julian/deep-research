This advanced approach utilizes robust text splitting techniques and vectorized embedding methods to enhance the retrieval and generation process. By leveraging header-based segmentation, recursive splitting, and a multi-phase retrieval and optimization process, the LangGraph RAG agent preserves the integrity of the documents in a coherent and query-friendly format. Unlike default methods that rely on straightforward concatenation of structured chunks, this solution provides a more nuanced integration of information from multiple sources.

- Ensuring proper integration of content from both documents is crucial for creating a cohesive final product. While default approaches often rely on straightforward concatenation of structured chunks, leveraging the nuances and scalability offered by advanced configurations can enhance the integration process. This versatile framework is applicable to a wide range of fields, from legal documentation to healthcare research[^1][^4].

# Using a LangGraph RAG Agent to Combine Markdown Documents

You can use a LangGraph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent to intelligently combine two different markdown documents. This process involves merging overlapping information, preserving unique points from each document, and maintaining a coherent flow. The main content is presented first, followed by the sources at the bottom.

## Main Content

The LangGraph RAG agent is designed to handle the integration of content from multiple markdown documents efficiently. It ensures that the combined document retains the essential information from each source while eliminating redundancy. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require the synthesis of information from various documents, such as research papers or technical documentation.

This combined version integrates the main idea from the first section about using a LangGraph RAG agent and includes the sources from the second section, ensuring a seamless and informative document.

Here's how you can achieve this:
Here's how you can achieve this:

- Generating queries for each document
    - Retrieving relevant sections from both documents
    - Using an LLM to synthesize the information into a coherent response[^1][^5]
4. Source Attribution: Implement a step in your LangGraph workflow to extract and compile the sources from both documents. This can be done by:
    - Identifying source sections in each document
    - Combining and deduplicating sources
    - Appending the compiled sources to the end of the generated content[^1][^5]



To combine and deduplicate sources from two documents while maintaining proper markdown footnote format, you would follow these steps:

1. **List all sources from both documents.**
2. **Identify duplicates by comparing the content of each source.**
3. **Retain the original reference number for each unique source.**
4. **If a source appears in both documents, choose one reference number to keep.**

Since you haven't provided specific sources from the documents, I'll demonstrate the process with hypothetical examples:

### Sources from First Document:

1. Smith, J. (2020). *Understanding AI*. New York: Tech Press. [^1]
2. Johnson, L. (2019). *Machine Learning Basics*. San Francisco: ML Books. [^2]
3. Brown, T. (2021). *Data Science Essentials*. Boston: Data Press. [^3]

### Sources from Second Document:

1. Johnson, L. (2019). *Machine Learning Basics*. San Francisco: ML Books. [^1]
2. Davis, K. (2022). *AI in Healthcare*. Chicago: HealthTech. [^2]
3. Smith, J. (2020). *Understanding AI*. New York: Tech Press. [^3]

### Combined and Deduplicated Sources:

1. Smith, J. (2020). *Understanding AI*. New York: Tech Press. [^1]
2. Johnson, L. (2019). *Machine Learning Basics*. San Francisco: ML Books. [^2]
3. Brown, T. (2021). *Data Science Essentials*. Boston: Data Press. [^3]
4. Davis, K. (2022). *AI in Healthcare*. Chicago: HealthTech. [^4]

### Footnotes:

[^1]: Smith, J. (2020). *Understanding AI*. New York: Tech Press.
[^2]: Johnson, L. (2019). *Machine Learning Basics*. San Francisco: ML Books.
[^3]: Brown, T. (2021). *Data Science Essentials*. Boston: Data Press.
[^4]: Davis, K. (2022). *AI in Healthcare*. Chicago: HealthTech.

In this example, the sources from both documents were compared, and duplicates were removed. The original reference numbers were maintained where possible, and new numbers were assigned to unique sources from the second document. Adjust the process according to the actual sources you have.
