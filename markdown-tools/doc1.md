# Understanding RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative AI systems. It enhances the capabilities of large language models by providing them with relevant external knowledge during generation.

## Key Components

1. Document Storage: RAG systems store documents in vector databases for efficient retrieval
2. Embedding Generation: Documents are converted into vector representations
3. Retrieval System: Finds relevant documents based on queries
4. Generation: Uses retrieved context to generate accurate responses

## Benefits

- Improved accuracy through external knowledge
- Better factual grounding
- Reduced hallucination
