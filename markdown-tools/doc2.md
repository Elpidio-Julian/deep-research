# RAG Systems in Practice

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in AI systems, combining retrieval mechanisms with generative AI to produce more accurate and reliable outputs.

## Implementation Details

1. Vector Databases: Modern RAG systems use efficient vector stores like Pinecone or Faiss
2. Embedding Models: Transformer-based models convert text to dense vectors
3. Similarity Search: Uses cosine similarity or other metrics to find relevant content
4. Context Window Management: Optimizes the amount of retrieved context

## Advanced Features

- Dynamic retrieval strategies
- Hybrid search capabilities
- Source attribution

## Use Cases

- Question answering systems
- Document summarization
- Content generation with citations
